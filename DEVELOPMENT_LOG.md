# Development Log - Blockchain Explorer

This document tracks my experiences, discoveries, and challenges while building the Ethereum blockchain explorer.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup âœ…

### Cool Discoveries ðŸš€
- **go-ethereum SDK**: Incredibly comprehensive - handles all the low-level blockchain interactions seamlessly
- **PostgreSQL JSONB**: Perfect for storing flexible blockchain data while maintaining query performance
- **Gin Framework**: Lightweight and fast, great for building REST APIs quickly
- **Next.js App Router**: The new app directory structure is much cleaner than pages router
- **Docker Compose**: Makes local development environment setup trivial

### Pain Points ðŸ˜…
- **Go Module Dependencies**: Had to fix return type mismatch in BlockNumber() - go-ethereum returns uint64 but we needed *big.Int
- **TypeScript Errors**: Frontend shows many TS errors until npm install runs (expected in development)
- **Database Schema**: Designing for Ethereum's variable transaction structure required careful JSONB usage
- **Import Organization**: Go's auto-formatter reordered imports, need to be careful with SEARCH/REPLACE operations

### Key Learnings
- Using conventional commits from the start helps track progress
- Docker development environment is essential for blockchain projects
- PostgreSQL's NUMERIC(78,0) type handles Ethereum's big integers perfectly
- Go's error handling pattern works well for blockchain operations

## Phase 2: Core Explorer Features âœ…

### What I Built
- **Comprehensive Data Ingestion**: Full service for fetching blocks and transactions from Ethereum
- **Complete REST API**: All endpoints for blocks, transactions, addresses with pagination
- **React Components**: Professional-looking tables with proper formatting and navigation
- **Search Integration**: Multi-type search supporting blocks, transactions, and addresses

### Cool Discoveries ðŸš€
- **PostgreSQL UPSERT**: Using ON CONFLICT for idempotent data ingestion
- **Go Error Handling**: Clean error propagation through the ingestion pipeline
- **Next.js App Router**: useSearchParams hook makes query parameter handling elegant
- **Tailwind Utilities**: Custom CSS classes in globals.css work perfectly with Tailwind

### Pain Points ðŸ˜…
- **Big Integer Handling**: Converting between Go's *big.Int and PostgreSQL NUMERIC types
- **Nullable Fields**: Lots of sql.NullString handling for optional blockchain data
- **TypeScript Errors**: Expected until npm install runs, but structure is solid
- **Gas Price Formatting**: Converting wei to gwei requires careful decimal handling

### Key Learnings
- Blockchain data has many optional fields that need careful null handling
- Pagination is essential for blockchain explorers due to large datasets
- Real-time subscriptions need proper cleanup to avoid memory leaks
- Frontend formatting functions are crucial for user-friendly display

## Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Next)

### Planned Features
- WebSocket real-time updates
- Advanced search with filters
- Transaction flow visualization
- Gas price analytics dashboard
