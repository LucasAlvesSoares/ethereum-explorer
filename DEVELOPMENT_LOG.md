# Development Log - Blockchain Explorer

This document tracks my experiences, discoveries, and challenges while building the Ethereum blockchain explorer.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup âœ…

### Cool Discoveries ðŸš€
- **go-ethereum SDK**: Incredibly comprehensive - handles all the low-level blockchain interactions seamlessly
- **PostgreSQL JSONB**: Perfect for storing flexible blockchain data while maintaining query performance
- **Gin Framework**: Lightweight and fast, great for building REST APIs quickly
- **Next.js App Router**: The new app directory structure is much cleaner than pages router
- **Docker Compose**: Makes local development environment setup trivial

### Pain Points ðŸ˜…
- **Go Module Dependencies**: Had to fix return type mismatch in BlockNumber() - go-ethereum returns uint64 but we needed *big.Int
- **TypeScript Errors**: Frontend shows many TS errors until npm install runs (expected in development)
- **Database Schema**: Designing for Ethereum's variable transaction structure required careful JSONB usage
- **Import Organization**: Go's auto-formatter reordered imports, need to be careful with SEARCH/REPLACE operations

### Key Learnings
- Using conventional commits from the start helps track progress
- Docker development environment is essential for blockchain projects
- PostgreSQL's NUMERIC(78,0) type handles Ethereum's big integers perfectly
- Go's error handling pattern works well for blockchain operations

## Phase 2: Core Explorer Features (In Progress)

### Current Focus
- Implementing block data ingestion service
- Creating proper API endpoints for blocks and transactions
- Building React components for data display

### Next Steps
- [ ] Complete block ingestion service
- [ ] Add transaction processing
- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Add WebSocket for real-time updates
